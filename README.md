# Kingdom
This is an initial alpha version of my game, Kingdom.<br>
It uses the Raylib library for C++.<br>
The files I have written are exclusively those in the src directory. <br>
I do not claim ownership over the assets in the "assets" folder. They are intended to be placeholder images, and are to be replaced at a later stage.

## Usage
(Tested only on Linux, VS Code)
Run F5 to build/run/debug the program.
